## Background

Anchor's origins were in a research project at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) involving marked-point-processes. Certain data
objects and algorithms found in the software borrows terminology from this subject area.

## What are Marked Point Processes?

They are extensions of classical point-processes that additionally associate a *mark* (extra attributes) with each point produced in
the process.

A more mathematical introduction can be found in [Marked Point Processes by Tonglin Zhang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~huang251/point2.pdf).
