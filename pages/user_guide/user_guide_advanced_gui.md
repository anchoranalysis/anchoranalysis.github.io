## Introduction

The **Anchor GUI** is a desktop tool that can view and interactively query the inputs and outputs of an anchor experiment.

{% include callout.html content="The command `anchor-gui` will launch it in an [Anchor distribution](developer_guide_anchor_distribution.html)" %}

{% include warning.html content="The GUI application is a mostly (legacy) tool of past research projects. It is poorly documented, not maintained to same standards as other parts of Anchor. It will be likely deprecated in the near future." %}

## What can I do with the GUI application?

The GUI application supports:
- Loading sets of images.
- Visualizing collections of objects and marks on top of individual images (including time-series and 3D).
- Interactive feature querying and calculation for objects and marks (click on objects and see its features!).
- Collecting ground truth by adding annotations (labels or marks) on top of images.
- Replaying optimization processes from the serialized output recorded during execution.
