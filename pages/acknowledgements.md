Anchor's author is [Owen Feehan](http://www.owenfeehan.com/). Particular additional thanks to:

* [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), the late [Prof. Wilhelm Krek](https://mhs.biol.ethz.ch/research/krek/biography-krek.html) in whose lab the software originated for analyzing microscopy images.
* Many members of the [Institute of Molecular Health Sciences](https://mhs.biol.ethz.ch/) who kindly helped in associated research and became the first users, and similarly Dr. Naemi Luithle.
* The [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) where further development occurred with particular thanks to [Dr. Lars Malmstrom](http://2ddb.org/).
* [Hoffmann-La Roche](https://www.roche.com/) with usage and advancement across several imaging projects.

The software depends on many publicly available libraries, but to highlight some in particular:

* [Bioformats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/) from the [Open Microscopy Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/about/) (OME).
* [ImageJ/Fiji](https://imagej.net/Welcome) and its [contributors](https://imagej.net/Contributors#Fiji).
* [path-pattern-finder](https://path-pattern-finder.github.io/) also by Owen Feehan.
* And thanks to [Tom Johnson](https://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/) who authored the [theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html) for the website.

Please see the `NOTICE.txt` and `notice/` sub-directories of each source-code repository for more detailed acknowledgement of libraries.
