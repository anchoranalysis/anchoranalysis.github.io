## Introduction

A **HTML / Markdown / CSS** repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/anchoranalysis/anchoranalysis.github.io), serving [http://www.anchoranalysis.org](http://www.anchoranalysis.org).

The website is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) automatically after any changes, as it is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Particular thanks to [Tom Johnson](https://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/) who authored the [theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html) that determines the style and much of the structure of the website.

### What belongs in the repository?

{% include tip.html content="Anything for the website, except binary downloads." %}

## Running locally
