Anchor can be downloaded as a distribution (zip or tar.gz). This must be unpacked into a directory, followed by setting some environment variables.

Please download the [latest version](http://www.github.org/blahblah) from GitHub and then follow the Installation guide.

{% include warning.html content="Anchor is currently only available pre-alpha, due to ongoing [project status](/index.html#projectStatus)." %}


## Licensing {#licensing}

Most components of Anchor are licensed under the permissive open-source MIT License, but a small number rather under the less-permissive GPLv3. As a hybrid of both, the Anchor distribution is GPLv3 licensed. Please see the `LICENSE.txt` in each repository and distribution.
